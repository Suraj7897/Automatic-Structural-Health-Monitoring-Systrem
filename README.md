Developing an embedded system for
detecting and analysing structural integrity of bridges and buildings.
The system should be able to collect data from various sensors such
as strain gauges, accelerometers and cameras and use machine
learning algorithms to detect any variations in the structure and
predict potential failures. The system should also be able to send
alerts to the relevant authorities and engineers to inspect the
structure in case of any issues. Various parameters should be
considered like length of the bridge, traffic rate, wind speed, unequal
loads, etc.
